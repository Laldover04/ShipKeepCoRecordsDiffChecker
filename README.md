Project Description




Interviewer notes
// Databases
  // oracle instead of file reader
    - Relational database usage

// think about security
    - All business and personal users of software want their privacy protected, especially their sensitive business or health information 

// real situation ideas
    - Think about who the client is, what they would want and need out of your project. 
        - Security? Accessibility? Versatility?

// just use hashmap 
    - avoid going back to the sheet to iterate. Your local data structure will be faster. find a way to traverse all elements.

// csv is easier
    - Comma Separated Values, can write strings and put it in a file.

// make it more versatile
      - may use euros instead of dollars
      - automatic preprocessing, comparing the ECB to the TAR file to see what the differences are and making a formatting formula based on the difference.
// Think about what the input may be in the futuer
